libvirt releases
================

# v2.5.0 (unreleased)

   * New features

      - shmem: Add support for additional models
          The shmem device can now utilize QEMU's ivshmem-plain and
          ivshmem-doorbell, more modern versions of ivshmem

      - vbox: Add VirtualBox 5.1 support

      - libssh: New transport
          The new libssh transport allows one to connect to a running
          libvirtd via SSH, using the libssh library; for example:
          qemu+libssh://server/system

      - vhost-scsi: Add support scsi_host hostdev passthrough
          Add the capability to pass through a scsi_host HBA and the
          associated LUNs to the guest

      - qemu: Users can now enable debug logging for native gluster
          volumes in qemu using the "gluster_debug_level" option in qemu.conf

      - memory hotplug: Slot numbers for memory devices are now
          automatically allocated and thus persistent. In addition slot numbers
          can be specified without providing a base address, which simplifies
          user configuration

      - qemu: Express devices will be placed on PCIe bus by default
          For machine types that use a PCI Express root bus
          (e.g. x86_64/Q35 and aarch64/virt), any unaddressed PCI
          device that is an Express device (all virtio-1.0 devices,
          e1000e, nec-xhci, vfio assigned devices) will be placed on
          an Express controller (i.e. a pcie-root-port) instead of a
          legacy PCI controller (i.e. pci-bridge) with the root ports
          added as needed

   * Improvements

      - docs: Better documentation for migration APIs and flags

      - vbox: Address thread safety issues

      - virsh: Add support for passing an alternative persistent XML
          to migrate command

      - vhostuser: Allow hotplug of multiqueue devices

      - NEWS: Switch to an improved format
          List user-visible changes instead of single commits for a better
          high-level overview of differences between libvirt releases

      - website: Modernize layout and branding
          The libvirt website looked very cluttered and outdated; it has now
          been completely overhauled, resulting in a design that's better
          organized and more pleasant to look at

   * Bug fixes

      - vz: Fix migration in P2P mode

      - Forbid newline character in names of some libvirt objects

      - Fix compilation on macOS
