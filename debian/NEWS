libvirt (0.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

 If you're using a script such as /etc/qemu-ifup to set up QEMU network
 interfaces, have a look at README.Debian about the new config option
 clear_emulator_capabilities in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf.
 When using NAT via libvirt's default network you don't have to change
 anything.
