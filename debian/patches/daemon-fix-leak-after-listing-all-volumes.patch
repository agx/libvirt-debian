Subject: daemon: fix leak after listing all volumes

CVE-2013-1962

remoteDispatchStoragePoolListAllVolumes wasn't freeing the pool.
The pool also held a reference to the connection, preventing it from
getting freed and closing the netcf interface driver, which held two
sockets open.

Closes: #708647
