    <h1 >Bindings for other languages</h1>
    <p>Libvirt comes with bindings to support other languages than
pure C. First the headers embeds the necessary declarations to
allow direct acces from C++ code, but also we have bindings for
higher level kind of languages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Python: Libvirt comes with direct support for the Python language
     (just make sure you installed the libvirt-python package if not
     compiling from sources). See below for more information about
     using libvirt with python</li>
      <li>Perl: Daniel Berrange provides <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Sys-Virt/">bindings for
     Perl</a>.</li>
      <li>OCaml: Richard Jones supplies <a href="http://libvirt.org/ocaml/">bindings for OCaml</a>.</li>
      <li>Ruby: David Lutterkort provides <a href="http://libvirt.org/ruby/">bindings for Ruby</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Support, requests or help for libvirt bindings are welcome on
the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvir-list/">mailing
list</a>, as usual try to provide enough background information
and make sure you use recent version, see the <a href="bugs.html">help
page</a>.</p>
