      with an  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/">on-line archive</a>.
      Please subscribe to this list before posting by visiting the
      <a href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvir-list">associated Web</a>
      page and follow the instructions. Patches with explanations and provided as
      attachments are really appreciated and will be discussed on the mailing list.

    <h2>IRC discussion</h2>

    <p>
      Some of the libvirt developers may be found on IRC on the <a href="http://oftc.net">OFTC IRC</a>
      network. Use the settings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>server: irc.oftc.net</li>
      <li>port: 6667 (the usual IRC port)</li>
      <li>channel: #virt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      NB There is no guarantee that someone will be watching or able to reply
      promptly, so use the mailing-list if you don't get an answer on the IRC
      channel.
