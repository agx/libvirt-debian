Some simple examples on how to use the Python API for libvirt

The examples are:

dominfo.py  - print information about a running domU based on the results of
              virDomainGetInfo and virDomainGetXMLDesc
domstart.py - create a domU from an XML description if the domU isn't 
              running yet 
domsave.py  - save all running domU's into a directory
domrestore.py - restore domU's from their saved files in a directory

The XML files in this directory are examples of the XML format that libvirt
expects, and will have to be adapted for your setup. They are only needed
for domstart.py
