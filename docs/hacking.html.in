    <h2><a name="patches">General tips for contributing patches</a></h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Discuss any large changes on the mailing list first.  Post patches
        early and listen to feedback.</li>

      <li><p>Post patches in unified diff format.  A command similar to this
          should work:</p>
        <pre>
  diff -urp libvirt.orig/ libvirt.modified/ &gt; libvirt-myfeature.patch
</pre>
        <p>
          or:
        </p>
        <pre>
  cvs diff -up > libvirt-myfeature.patch
</pre></li>
      <li>Split large changes into a series of smaller patches, self-contained
        if possible, with an explanation of each patch and an explanation of how
        the sequence of patches fits together.</li>
      <li>Make sure your patches apply against libvirt CVS.  Developers
        only follow CVS and don't care much about released versions.</li>
      <li><p>Run the automated tests on your code before submitting any changes.
          In particular, configure with compile warnings set to -Werror:</p>
        <pre>
  ./configure --enable-compile-warnings=error
</pre>
        <p>
          and run the tests:
        </p>
        <pre>
  make check
  make syntax-check
  make -C tests valgrind
</pre>
        <p>
          The latter test checks for memory leaks.
        </p>

      <li>Update tests and/or documentation, particularly if you are adding
        a new feature or changing the output of a program.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      There is more on this subject, including lots of links to background
      reading on the subject, on
      <a href="http://et.redhat.com/~rjones/how-to-supply-code-to-open-source-projects/">
        Richard Jones' guide to working with open source projects</a>
    </p>


    <h2><a name="indent">Code indentation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Libvirt's C source code generally adheres to some basic code-formatting
      conventions.  The existing code base is not totally consistent on this
      front, but we do prefer that contributed code be formatted similarly.
      In short, use spaces-not-TABs for indentation, use 4 spaces for each
      indentation level, and other than that, follow the K&amp;R style.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use Emacs, add the following to one of one of your start-up files
      (e.g., ~/.emacs), to help ensure that you get indentation right:
    </p>
    <pre>
  ;;; When editing C sources in libvirt, use this style.
  (defun libvirt-c-mode ()
    "C mode with adjusted defaults for use with libvirt."
    (interactive)
    (c-set-style "K&amp;R")
    (setq indent-tabs-mode nil) ; indent using spaces, not TABs
    (setq c-indent-level 4)
    (setq c-basic-offset 4))
  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
            '(lambda () (if (string-match "/libvirt" (buffer-file-name))
                            (libvirt-c-mode))))
</pre>

    <h2><a name="formatting">Code formatting (especially for new code)</a></h2>

    <p>
      With new code, we can be even more strict.
      Please apply the following function (using GNU indent) to any new code.
      Note that this also gives you an idea of the type of spacing we prefer
      around operators and keywords:
    </p>

    <pre>
  indent-libvirt()
  {
    indent -bad -bap -bbb -bli4 -br -ce -brs -cs -i4 -l75 -lc75 \
      -sbi4 -psl -saf -sai -saw -sbi4 -ss -sc -cdw -cli4 -npcs -nbc \
      --no-tabs "$@"
  }
</pre>

    <p>
      Note that sometimes you'll have to postprocess that output further, by
      piping it through "expand -i", since some leading TABs can get through.
      Usually they're in macro definitions or strings, and should be converted
      anyhow.
    </p>


    <h2><a href="types">C types</a></h2>

    <p>
      Use the right type.
    </p>

    <h3>Scalars</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>If you're using "int" or "long", odds are good that there's a better type.</li>
      <li>If a variable is counting something, be sure to declare it with an
        unsigned type.</li>
      <li>If it's memory-size-related, use size_t (use ssize_t only if required).</li>
      <li>If it's file-size related, use uintmax_t, or maybe off_t.</li>
      <li>If it's file-offset related (i.e., signed), use off_t.</li>
      <li>If it's just counting small numbers use "unsigned int";
        (on all but oddball embedded systems, you can assume that that
        type is at least four bytes wide).</li>
      <li>If a variable has boolean semantics, give it the "bool" type
        and use the corresponding "true" and "false" macros.  It's ok
        to include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;, since libvirt's use of gnulib ensures
          that it exists and is usable.</li>
      <li>In the unusual event that you require a specific width, use a
        standard type like int32_t, uint32_t, uint64_t, etc.</li>
      <li>While using "bool" is good for readability, it comes with minor caveats:
        <ul>
          <li>Don't use "bool" in places where the type size must be constant across
            all systems, like public interfaces and on-the-wire protocols.  Note
            that it would be possible (albeit wasteful) to use "bool" in libvirt's
            logical wire protocol, since XDR maps that to its lower-level bool_t
            type, which *is* fixed-size.</li>
          <li>Don't compare a bool variable against the literal, "true",
            since a value with a logical non-false value need not be "1".
            I.e., don't write "if (seen == true) ...".  Rather, write "if (seen)...".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Of course, take all of the above with a grain of salt.  If you're about
      to use some system interface that requires a type like size_t, pid_t or
      off_t, use matching types for any corresponding variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, if you try to use e.g., "unsigned int" as a type, and that
      conflicts with the signedness of a related variable, sometimes
      it's best just to use the *wrong* type, if "pulling the thread"
      and fixing all related variables would be too invasive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, while using descriptive types is important, be careful not to
      go overboard.  If whatever you're doing causes warnings, or requires
      casts, then reconsider or ask for help.
    </p>

    <h3>Pointers</h3>

    <p>
      Ensure that all of your pointers are "const-correct".
      Unless a pointer is used to modify the pointed-to storage,
      give it the "const" attribute.  That way, the reader knows
      up-front that this is a read-only pointer.  Perhaps more
      importantly, if we're diligent about this, when you see a non-const
      pointer, you're guaranteed that it is used to modify the storage
      it points to, or it is aliased to another pointer that is.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="memalloc">Low level memory management</a></h2>

    <p>
      Use of the malloc/free/realloc/calloc APIs is deprecated in the libvirt
      codebase, because they encourage a number of serious coding bugs and do
      not enable compile time verification of checks for NULL. Instead of these
      routines, use the macros from memory.h
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>eg to allocate  a single object:</p>

<pre>
      virDomainPtr domain;

      if (VIR_ALLOC(domain) &lt; 0) {
         __virRaiseError(VIR_ERROR_NO_MEMORY)
         return NULL;
      }
</pre></li>

      <li><p>eg to allocate an array of objects</p>

<pre>
       virDomainPtr domains;
       int ndomains = 10;

       if (VIR_ALLOC_N(domains, ndomains) &lt; 0) {
         __virRaiseError(VIR_ERROR_NO_MEMORY)
         return NULL;
       }
</pre></li>

      <li><p>eg to allocate an array of object pointers</p>

<pre>
       virDomainPtr *domains;
       int ndomains = 10;

       if (VIR_ALLOC_N(domains, ndomains) &lt; 0) {
         __virRaiseError(VIR_ERROR_NO_MEMORY)
         return NULL;
       }
</pre></li>

      <li><p>eg to re-allocate the array of domains to be longer</p>

<pre>
       ndomains = 20

       if (VIR_REALLOC_N(domains, ndomains) &lt; 0) {
         __virRaiseError(VIR_ERROR_NO_MEMORY)
         return NULL;
       }
</pre></li>

      <li><p>eg to free the domain</p>

<pre>
       VIR_FREE(domain);
</pre></li>
    </ul>



    <h2><a name="string">String comparisons</a></h2>

    <p>
      Do not use the strcmp, strncmp, etc functions directly. Instead use
      one of the following semantically named macros
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>For strict equality:</p>
        <pre>
     STREQ(a,b)
     STRNEQ(a,b)
</pre>
      </li>

      <li><p>For case sensitive equality:</p>
        <pre>
     STRCASEEQ(a,b)
     STRCASENEQ(a,b)
</pre>
      </li>

      <li><p>For strict equality of a substring:</p>

        <pre>
     STREQLEN(a,b,n)
     STRNEQLEN(a,b,n)
</pre>
      </li>

      <li><p>For case sensitive equality of a substring:</p>

        <pre>
     STRCASEEQLEN(a,b,n)
     STRCASENEQLEN(a,b,n)
</pre>
      </li>

      <li><p>For strict equality of a prefix:</p>

        <pre>
     STRPREFIX(a,b)
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2><a name="strbuf">Variable length string buffer</a></h2>

    <p>
      If there is a need for complex string concatenations, avoid using
      the usual sequence of malloc/strcpy/strcat/snprintf functions and
      make use of the virBuffer API described in buf.h
    </p>

    <p>eg typical usage is as follows:</p>

    <pre>
  char *
  somefunction(...) {
     virBuffer buf = VIR_BUFFER_INITIALIZER;

     ...

     virBufferAddLit(&amp;buf, "&lt;domain&gt;\n");
     virBufferVSprint(&amp;buf, "  &lt;memory&gt;%d&lt;/memory&gt;\n", memory);
     ...
     virBufferAddLit(&amp;buf, "&lt;/domain&gt;\n");

     ...

     if (virBufferError(&amp;buf)) {
         virBufferFreeAndReset(&amp;buf);
         virReportOOMError(...);
         return NULL;
     }

     return virBufferContentAndReset(&amp;buf);
  }
</pre>


    <h2><a name="includes">Include files</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are now quite a large number of include files, both libvirt
      internal and external, and system includes.  To manage all this
      complexity it's best to stick to the following general plan for all
      *.c source files:
    </p>

    <pre>
  /*
   * Copyright notice
   * ....
   * ....
   * ....
   *
   */

  #include &lt;config.h&gt;             Must come first in every file.

  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;              Any system includes you need.
  #include &lt;string.h&gt;
  #include &lt;limits.h&gt;

  #if HAVE_NUMACTL                Some system includes aren't supported
  #include &lt;numa.h&gt;               everywhere so need these #if defences.
  #endif

  #include "internal.h"           Include this first, after system includes.

  #include "util.h"               Any libvirt internal header files.
  #include "buf.h"

  static myInternalFunc ()        The actual code.
  {
    ...
</pre>

    <p>
      Of particular note: *DO NOT* include libvirt/libvirt.h or
      libvirt/virterror.h.  It is included by "internal.h" already and there
      are some special reasons why you cannot include these files
      explicitly.
    </p>


    <h2><a name="printf">Printf-style functions</a></h2>

    <p>
      Whenever you add a new printf-style function, i.e., one with a format
      string argument and following "..." in its prototype, be sure to use
      gcc's printf attribute directive in the prototype.  For example, here's
      the one for virAsprintf, in util.h:
    </p>

    <pre>
    int virAsprintf(char **strp, const char *fmt, ...)
        ATTRIBUTE_FORMAT(printf, 2, 3);
</pre>

    <p>
      This makes it so gcc's -Wformat and -Wformat-security options can do
      their jobs and cross-check format strings with the number and types
      of arguments.
    </p>



    <h2><a name="committers">Libvirt commiters guidelines</a></h2>

    <p>
      The AUTHORS files indicates the list of people with commit acces right
      who can actually merge the patches.
    </p>

    <p>
      The general rule for commiting patches is to make sure it has been reviewed
      properly in the mailing-list first, usually if a couple of persons gave an
      ACK or +1 to a patch and nobody raised an objection on the list it should
      be good to go. If the patch touches a part of the code where you're not the
      main maintainer or not have a very clear idea of how things work, it's better
      to wait for a more authoritative feedback though. Before commiting please
      also rebuild locally and run 'make check syntax-check' and make sure they
      don't raise error. Try to look for warnings too for example configure with
      --enable-compile-warnings=error
      which adds -Werror to compile flags, so no warnings get missed
    </p>

    <p>
      Exceptions to that 'review and approval on the list first' is fixing failures
      to build:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>if a recently commited patch breaks compilation on a platform
        or for a given driver then it's fine to commit a minimal fix
        directly without getting the review feedback first</li>
      <li>if make check or make syntax-chek breaks, if there is
        an obvious fix, it's fine to commit immediately.
        The patch should still be sent to the list (or tell what the fix was if
        trivial) and 'make check syntax-check' should pass too before commiting
        anything</li>
      <li>
        fixes for documentation and code comments can be managed
        in the same way, but still make sure they get reviewed if non-trivial.
      </li>
    </ul>
