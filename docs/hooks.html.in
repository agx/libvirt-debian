    <h1>Hooks for specific system management</h1>
    <p>Libvirt includes synchronous hooks, starting from version 0.8.0, as a
       way to tie in specific tailored system actions at a specific time.
       If these scripts are present on the host where the hypervisor
       is running, then they are called when the libvirt daemon is doingi
       some significant action.</p>
    <p>The scripts are expected to execute quickly, return a zero exit
       status if all conditions are set for the daemon to continue the
       action (non zero will be considered a failure which may
       be ignored but in general will stop the ongoing operation).
       The script also should not call back into libvirt as the daemon
       is waiting for the script exit and deadlock is likely to occur.</p>
    <p>The scripts are stored in the directory <code>/etc/libvirt/hooks/</code>
       when using a standard installation path
       (<code>$SYSCONF_DIR/libvirt/hooks/</code> in general).</p>
    <p>Each script is given the following command line arguments:</p>
       <ul>
         <li> the first argument is the name of the object involved in the
              operation, or '-' if there is none.
         <li> the second argument is the name of the operation.
         <li> the third argument is a suboperation indication like 'start' or
              'end', or '-' if there is none.
         <li> the last argument is an extra argument string or '-' if there
              is none.
       </ul>
    <p>There are currently scripts for 3 domains of operation:
    <ul>
      <li><p><code>/etc/libvirt/hooks/daemon</code> script if
          present is called at 3 points in time:</p>
          <p>at daemon startup, typically started with the following
             arguments:</p>
                <pre>/etc/libvirt/hooks/daemon - start - start</pre>
            <p>at daemon shutdown when it is about to exit, with the following
                arguments:</p>
                <pre>/etc/libvirt/hooks/daemon - shutdown - shutdown</pre>
            <p>When the daemon is asked to reload its driver state when
                receiving the SIGHUP signal, arguments are:</p>
                <pre>/etc/libvirt/hooks/daemon - reload begin SIGHUP</pre>
          </li>
      <li><p><code>/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu</code> script and <br/>
             <code>/etc/libvirt/hooks/lxc</code> associate hooks for domain
             operation on the respective QEmu/KVM and LXC drivers.</p>
          <p> The domain related hooks also receive the full XML description
              for the concerned domain on their stdin, which allows them to get
              all the information from the domain, including UUID or storage
              if that is needed for the script operation.</p>
          <p> Currently only domain startup and domain end operations
              involve the hook, the first one just before the domain gets
              created.
              For example if starting a QEmu domain named <code>test</code>
              the following script will get called:</p>
              <pre>/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu test start begin -</pre>
          <p> note that a non-zero return value from the script will abort the
              domain startup operation, and if an error string is passed on
              stderr by the hook script, it will be provided back to the user
              at the libvirt API level.</p>
          <p> For domain shutdown, the script will be called just after the
              domain has finished execution, and the script will get:</p>
              <pre>/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu test stopped end -</pre>
          <p> It is expected that other operations will be associated to hooks
              but at the time of 0.8.0 only those 2 are associated to the
              domains life cycle</p>
          </li>
    </ul>
