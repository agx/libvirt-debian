      <info><![CDATA[This API is QEMU specific, so it will only work with hypervisor
connections to the QEMU driver.

This API will attach to an externally launched QEMU process
identified by @pid. There are several requirements to successfully
attach to an external QEMU process:

  - It must have been started with a monitor socket using the UNIX
    domain socket protocol.
  - No device hotplug/unplug, or other configuration changes can
    have been made via the monitor since it started.
  - The '-name' and '-uuid' arguments should have been set (not
    mandatory, but strongly recommended)

To date, the only platforms we know of where pid_t is larger than
unsigned int (64-bit Windows) also lack UNIX sockets, so the choice
of @pid_value as an unsigned int should not present any difficulties.

If successful, then the guest will appear in the list of running
domains for this connection, and other APIs should operate
normally (provided the above requirements were honored).]]></info>

Send an arbitrary monitor command @cmd to @domain through the
qemu monitor. There are several requirements to safely and
successfully use this API:

  - A @cmd that queries state without making any modifications is safe
  - A @cmd that alters state that is also tracked by libvirt is unsafe,
    and may cause libvirtd to crash
  - A @cmd that alters state not tracked by the current version of
    libvirt is possible as a means to test new qemu features before
    they have support in libvirt, but no guarantees are made to safety

If VIR_DOMAIN_QEMU_MONITOR_COMMAND_HMP is set, the command is
considered to be a human monitor command and libvirt will automatically
convert it into QMP if needed.  In that case the @result will also
be converted back from QMP.

If successful, @result will be filled with the string output of the
@cmd, and the caller must free this string.]]></info>
