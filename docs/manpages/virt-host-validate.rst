This tool validates that the host is configured in a suitable
way to run libvirt hypervisor drivers. If invoked without any
arguments it will check support for all hypervisor drivers it
is aware of. Optionally it can be given a particular hypervisor
type (``qemu``, ``lxc`` or ``bhyve``) to restrict the checks
to those relevant for that virtualization technology

EXIT STATUS

failure a non-zero status will be set.
