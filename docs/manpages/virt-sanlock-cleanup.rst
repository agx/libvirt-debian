SYNOPSIS
========

``virt-sanlock-cleanup``


DESCRIPTION
===========

This tool removes any resource lease files created by the sanlock
lock manager plugin. The resource lease files only need to exist
on disks when a guest using the resource is active. This script
reclaims the disk space used by resources which are not currently
active.


EXIT STATUS
===========

Upon successful processing of leases cleanup, an exit status
of 0 will be set. Upon fatal error a non-zero status will
be set.
