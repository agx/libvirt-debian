        <h3>
          <strong>v3.6.0 (2017-08-02)</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul><li>
            <strong>New features</strong>
            <ul><li>
          hyperv: Implement virDomainSetMemory and virDomainSendKey APIs
        </li><li>
          qemu: Support multiple PHBs for pSeries guests
        <br />
          pSeries guests can now have multiple PHBs (PCI Host Bridges), which
          show up as separate PCI domains in the guest. To create additional
          PHBs, simply add PCI controllers with model <code>pci-root</code>
          to the guest configuration.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Isolate hostdevs on pSeries guests
        <br />
          To enable better error reporting and recovery, unrelated hostdevs
          will now be automatically isolated on pSeries guests by placing them
          on separate PHBs (PCI Host Bridges).
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Improvements</strong>
            <ul><li>
          qemu: platform serial devices can now use chardev features
        <br />
          QEMU VMs that depend on platform serial devices can now use
          QEMU's <code>-chardev</code> option, which enables access to
          advanced features like log file configuration. This applies
          to the default serial devices for arm, aarch64, and some ppc
          configurations.
        </li><li>
          Require use of GCC 4.4 or Clang compilers
        <br />
          We only ever test libvirt with GCC or Clang (which
          provides a GCC compatible compilation environment).
          Between them, these compilers cover every supported
          operating system platform, including Windows.
        </li><li>
          qemu: shared disks with directsync cache should be safe for migration
        <br />
          At present shared disks can be migrated with either readonly or
          <code>cache=none</code>.  But <code>cache=directsync</code> should be
          safe for migration, because both <code>cache=directsync</code> and
          <code>cache=none</code> don't use the host page cache, and
          <code>cache=direct</code> write through qemu block layer cache.
        </li><li>
          Handle hotplug change on VLAN configuration using OVS
        <br />
          Libvirt was taught to handle VLAN change for running OVS interface.
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
            <ul><li>
          qemu: Use vCPU 'node-id' property and pass it back to qemu
        <br />
          vCPU properties gathered from query-hotpluggable-cpus need to be
          passed back to QEMU. As QEMU did not use the node-id property until
          now and libvirt forgot to pass it back properly (it was parsed but
          not passed around) we did not honor this.
        </li><li>
          Miscellaneous stream fixes
        <br />
          After introducing sparse stream features there were still some known
          bugs left. Those are fixed in this release.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Miscellaneous domain NS fixes
        <br />
          Libvirt starts qemu domains in separate Linux namespaces for a while
          now. However, there were still some bugs lingering. For instance
          libvirt did not know how to handle file based bind mounts.
        </li><li>
          Various CPU driver improvements
        <br />
          There were some minor bugs when using 'host-model' CPU.
        </li></ul>
          </li></ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>v3.5.0 (2017-07-04)</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul><li>
            <strong>New features</strong>
            <ul><li>
          qemu: Add support for loadparm for a boot device
        <br />
          Add an optional boot parameter 'loadparm' for a boot device.
          Loadparm is an 8 byte parameter that, when present, is queried by
          S390 guests via sclp or diag 308. Linux guests on S390 use it to
          select a boot entry.
        </li><li>
          Support controlling how video devices are exposed to the bhyve guests
        <br />
          The <code>vgaconf</code> attribute was added to <code>video</code>'s
          <code>driver</code> element. Possible values are: <code>on</code>,
          <code>off</code>, and <code>io</code>. It controlls the way how
          bhyve exposes video devices to its guests; various guest OSes might
          require different settings to boot properly.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Add support for live updates of coalesce settings
        <br />
          Users can now use <code>virsh update-device</code> to change
          the coalesce settings of an interfaces while the domain is
          running.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Allow VirtIO devices to use vIOMMU
        <br />
          It is now possible to turn on IOTBL for the vIOMMU and have VirtIO
          devices use it, provided they have been configured appropriately.
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Improvements</strong>
            <ul><li>
          qemu: block copy job can be used with persistent domains
        <br />
          Until now it was not possible to use block copy with persistent VMs.
          In use cases where it's not required to recover the job after VM
          shutdown, it's possible to specify VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_COPY_TRANSIENT_JOB
          flag to start the copy job.
        </li><li>
          JSON pseudo-protocol backing store parser supports new format of qemu 2.9
        <br />
          QEMU 2.9 modified a few structures corresponding to the JSON format
          of specifying a backing store for a disk image. Libvirt now implements
          the new format.
        </li><li>
          Capabilities now include info about host's CAT settings
        <br />
          Various information about resource control from the host is
          gathered and presented in capabilities if available.
        </li><li>
          apparmor: Several improvements
        <br />
          Allow access to Ceph config, EFI firmware on both x86_64 and
          aarch64, device tree on ppc64 and more.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Support host-model on POWER9 machines
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
            <ul><li>
          qemu: snapshot: retrieve image metadata from user provided files
        <br />
          Disk images of an external snapshot created with
          VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_REUSE_EXT flag specified would not be
          scanned for metadata after recent changes.

          The metadata is necessary to allow keeping relative paths between
          images when doing a block-commit.
        </li><li>
          Parse decimal numbers in a locale-independent way
        <br />
          Some locales, such as <code>de_DE</code> and <code>pt_BR</code>,
          use comma rather than dot to separate the integer part from the
          fractional part of a decimal number; however, several data sources
          such as the kernel use a locale-independent representation and need
          to be treated accordingly.
        </li><li>
          Support compilation with newer compiler and libc versions
        <br />
          Several fixes have been included to make compilation with Clang
          4.0.0, GCC 7.1 and glibc &gt;= 2.25.90 possible.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Query name for vhost-user interfaces at runtime
        <br />
          This makes it possible to use <code>virsh</code> subcommands such
          as <code>domiflist</code> and <code>domifstat</code> on vhost-user
          interfaces.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Set MTU for hotplugged interfaces correctly
        <br />
          When hotplugging a network interface, the MTU was only set on the
          guest side. Set it on the host side as well.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Forbid updating MTU for interfaces of running guests
        <br />
          The MTU setting can't be modified while the guest is running, so any
          attempt to alter it at runtime will now result in an error rather
          than being silently ignored.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Fix specifying QXL heads with older QEMU releases
        <br />
          Specifying the number of QXL heads was not working correctly for
          QEMU releases older than 1.6.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Fix migration to older libvirt/QEMU versions
        <br />
          When the guest is started, libvirt updates the CPU definition to
          reflect the actual CPU features to enforce ABI. We need to send
          original and updated CPU definition in order to support migration
          to older libvirt/QEMU versions. Only the updated CPU definition
          was sent to destination.
        </li></ul>
          </li></ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>v3.4.0 (2017-06-02)</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul><li>
            <strong>New features</strong>
            <ul><li>
          Improved streams to efficiently transfer sparseness
        <br />
          New extension to virStream was implemented so that
          virStorageVolDownload and virStorageVolUpload can preserve file
          sparseness.
        </li><li>
          I/O APIC type can be specified for QEMU/KVM domains
        <br />
          The <code>ioapic</code> tag was added to domain
          <code>features</code>, so the type of the I/O APIC can now
          be specified (e.g. putting it in userspace for KVM domains).
        </li><li>
          The reason for VM shutdown is reported, if known
        <br />
          QEMU 2.10 will be able to report the reason for shutting
          down (whether that was caused by the guest or not), and
          libvirt is prepared for that and reports that information in
          its shutdown event as well, if it is known.
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Improvements</strong>
            <ul><li>
          Repository now has new README.md file
        <br />
          The new file uses markdown syntax, so it looks better on
          github and possibly other web pages, but it has also more
          useful information. The old README is now symlink to the
          new file.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Use GICv2 by default for aarch64/virt TCG guests
        <br />
          The emulated GICv3 has some limitations that make it unusable as a
          default; use GICv2 until they're sorted out. This change makes it
          once again possible to run aarch64/virt guests on a x86_64 host
          without having to tweak their configuration.
        </li><li>
          Additional capabilities for the node_device module
        <br />
          Introduce two new capabilities to the node_device module. The first
          is for CCW devices, most common on the S390 architecture. The second
          is for fibre channel-backed SCSI devices and exposes the
          fc_remote_port sub-capability to SCSI target devices.
        </li><li>
          Node devices now report Mediated device capabilities
        <br />
          Endpoint devices support new <code>mdev</code> capability
          and their parents now report the supported types in new
          <code>mdev_types</code> capability.
        </li><li>
          Capabilities now report information about host caches
        <br />
          If supported in the kernel, host capabilities will now list
          L3 caches. The code for other levels was added as well, but
          only L3 caches are reported currently.
        </li><li>
          POWER9 CPU model was added
        <br />
          It is now properly reported in host capabilities.
        </li><li>
          libxl: NUMA sibling distances are now reported in host capabilities
        </li><li>
          VMDK version 3 files are now properly detected
        </li><li>
          Interrupt remapping and Extended interrupt mode for IOMMU devices
        <br />
          These two new features can now be controlled with new
          <code>&lt;driver intremap='on/off' eim='on/off'/&gt;</code>
          tag for <code>iommu</code> devices.
        </li><li>
          Graphics in libxl domains now have default addresses
        <br />
          Even though there were default addresses before this change,
          they were not saved in the XML. It is now possible to see
          and control the listen addresses properly.
        </li><li>
          Default USB controllers are now added for devices in libxl domains
        <br />
          Even though they were added automatically when USB device
          was attached, they could've been missing in some other
          cases. The logic is now fixed so there are always USB
          controllers, even if there was none of them in the specified
          XML.
        </li><li>
          Limits for RPC messages were increased
        <br />
          Hitting the RPC limits we have is easier every day, so they
          were increased once again and some guessing logic was
          improved as well. It is now possible to get more stats than
          ever using the <code>virConnectGetAllDomainStats()</code>
          call and push through even bigger requests and replies for
          all APIs.
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
            <ul><li>
          qemu: Create memory_backing_dir on startup
        <br />
          Libvirt's policy is that directories are created on startup if
          they don't exist. We've missed this one.
        </li><li>
          PCIe 4.0 cards now report proper link speeds
        <br />
          It could happen that the link speed for PCIe devices was not
          properly reported or the nodedev-dumpxml just failed. That
          was due to mistake in the field width, but should now work
          properly.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Do not report errors on shutdown
        <br />
          For some users, in some rare cases, it could happen that
          there was an error message "internal error: End of file from
          qemu monitor" in the logs even though no problem happened.
          The detection of these false positives was improved and such
          errors should not show any more.
        </li><li>
          User-specified UNIX socket paths for virtio channels should not be reset
        <br />
          It could happen, in some cases, that libvirt would mistake a
          user-specified path for its own generated one and thus
          remove it from the XML. The detection of such addresses was
          improved now.
        </li><li>
          Fix address reservation during RNG hot-plug
        <br />
          When error occurred in a specific point in time during the
          hot-plug of an RNG device, it could happen that an address
          was released even though another device was already using
          it, making it possible to hot-plug another device with that
          address, effectively having duplicated addresses in the XML.
        </li></ul>

        <h3>
          <strong>v3.3.0 (2017-05-05)</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul><li>
            <strong>New features</strong>
            <ul><li>
          net: Add support for coalesce settings
        <br />
          Enabling data batching through these settings can improve network
          performance for guests.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Add support for guest CPU cache specification
        <br />
          This features allows fine-grained control of the cache behavior
          of the guest CPU.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Add support for the qemu-xhci USB controller
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Improvements</strong>
            <ul><li>
          hyperv: Support Hyper-V 2012 and newer
        <br />
          Starting with Hyper-V 2012 the API has changed causing the existing
          driver to be unable to send and process requests properly. This has
          been resolved by adding abstractions to handle the differences and
          ease handling such breaks if they happen in the future.
        </li><li>
          libxl: Add support for nested HVM domains
        <br />
          Xen has supported nested HVM domains since version 4.4. The
          libvirt libxl driver now supports nested HVM domains by
          specifying the host-passthrough CPU mode when defining a
          domain.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Implement ACPI support for aarch64 guests
        <br />
          Up until this point, ACPI support was only advertised for x86_64
          guests and disabling it for aarch64 guests was not possible at all.
        </li><li>
          vz: Add support for changing the number of vCPUs
        </li><li>
          qemu: Automatically choose the best USB controller for guests
        <br />
          The recently introduced qemu-xhci USB controller is the best choice
          for both ppc64 and aarch64 guests, so use it by default on those
          architectures if available.
        </li><li>
          daemon: Increase default task limit for libvirtd
        <br />
          The default number of tasks for the pids cgroup controller is 512,
          which libvirtd can quickly bump into when starting lots of guests.
          Raise the limit to a more reasonable 32768.
        </li><li>
          docs: Include man pages describing key code names and values
        </li><li>
          virsh: Report initialization errors
        <br />
          Sometimes virsh might be unable to start: when that happens, report
          useful diagnostics instead of failing silently.
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
            <ul><li>
          nss: Don't require a network restart for libvirt_guest
        <br />
          Previously, the libvirt_guest NSS module would only work properly
          after the corresponding network had been restarted; now newly
          started guests will be reported correctly right away.
        </li><li>
          storage: Remove unavailable transient pools after restart
        <br />
          Solve an issue where transient storage pools would be stuck in an
          unmanageable state if the source disappeared and libvirtd was
          subsequently restarted.

          storage: Fix capacity value for LUKS encrypted volumes
        <br />
          The 'capacity' value (e.g. guest logical size) for a LUKS volume is
          smaller than the 'physical' value of the file in the file system, so
          we need to account for that.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Fix regression when hyperv/vendor_id feature is used
        <br />
          Guests using the feature would not be started at all; it is now
          possible to start them as expected.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Do not crash on USB address with no port and invalid bus

          crypto: Always pad data before encrypting it
        <br />
          If this step is not performed, when the data length matches the
          chunk size the decryption routines will misinterpret the last byte
          of data as the padding length and fail to decode it correctly.

        <h3>
          <strong>v3.2.0 (2017-04-02)</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul><li>
            <strong>New features</strong>
            <ul><li>
          The virt-host-validate tool now supports bhyve hypervisor
        </li><li>
          Introduce NVDIMM memory model
        <br />
          NVDIMM is new type of memory introduced into QEMU 2.6. The idea is
          that we have a non-volatile memory module that keeps the data
          persistent across domain reboots and offers much faster data
          accesses. However, due to a bug in QEMU, this feature is not enabled
          for QEMUs older than 2.9.0.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Introduce support for generic PCIe Root Ports
        <br />
          For new controllers, a generic device (pcie-root-port) will be used
          by default instead of the Intel-specific device (ioh3420), provided
          the QEMU binary supports it.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Add support for checking guest CPU ABI compatibility
        <br />
          When migrating a domain to a different host, restoring a domain from
          a file or reverting a snapshot libvirt will make sure the guest CPU
          QEMU presents to the guest OS exactly matches the one provided on
          the source host (or before the domain's state was saved). This
          enhanced check may also be requested when starting a new domain to
          ensure the virtual CPU exactly matches the one specified in the XML.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Add support to migrate using TLS
        <br />
          Add the ability to migrate QEMU guests using TLS via a new flag
          VIR_MIGRATE_TLS or virsh migrate '--tls' option. Requires using at
          least QEMU 2.9.0 in order to work properly.
        </li><li>
          qemu: add mediated devices framework support
        <br />
          Recent kernel version introduced new mediated device framework, so
          provide an initial support of this framework for libvirt, mainly by
          introducing a new host device type in the XML.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Add support for setting TSC frequency
        <br />
          Setting TSC frequency is required to enable migration for domains
          with 'invtsc' CPU feature turned on.
        </li><li>
          Add support for block device threshold event
        <br />
          When using thin provisioning, management tools need to resize the
          disk in certain cases. To avoid having them to poll disk usage
          this version introduces an event which will be fired when a given
          offset of the storage is written by the hypervisor. Together with the
          API it allows registering thresholds for given storage backing
          volumes and this event will then notify management if the threshold
          is exceeded. Currently only the qemu driver supports this.
        </li><li>
           bhyve: Add support for UEFI boot ROM, VNC, and USB tablet
        <br />
          The bhyve driver now supports booting using the UEFI boot ROM,
          so non-FreeBSD guests that support UEFI could be booted without
          using an external boot loader like grub-bhyve. Video is also
          supported now, allowing to connect to guests via VNC and use
          an USB tablet as an input device. Please refer to
          the driver page for domain XML examples.
        </li></ul>

            <strong>Improvements</strong>
            <ul><li>
          qemu: Detect host CPU model by asking QEMU on x86_64
        <br />
          Previously, libvirt detected the host CPU model using CPUID
          instruction, which caused libvirt to detect a lot of CPU features
          that are not supported by QEMU/KVM. Asking QEMU makes sure we
          don't start it with unsupported features.
        </li><li>
          perf: Add more perf statistics
        <br />
          Add support to get the count of cpu clock time, task clock time,
          page faults, context switches, cpu migrations, minor page faults,
          major page faults, alignment faults, emulation faults by
          applications running on the platform.
        </li><li>
          Write hyperv crash information into vm log
        <br />
          qemu's implementation of the hyperv panic notifier now reports
          information about the crash from the guest os. Starting with this
          version, libvirt logs the information to the vm log file for possible
          debugging.
        </li></ul>

            <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
            <ul><li>
          QEMU: Use adaptive timeout for connecting to monitor
        <br />
          When starting qemu, libvirt waits for qemu to create the monitor
          socket which libvirt connects to. Historically, there was sharp 30
          second timeout after which the qemu process was killed. This
          approach is suboptimal as in some scenarios with huge amounts of
          guest RAM it can take a minute or more for kernel to allocate and
          zero out pages for qemu. The timeout is now flexible and computed by
          libvirt at domain startup.

            <strong>New features</strong>
            <ul><li>
          storage: Add Virtuozzo storage backend storage pool
        <br />
          Add new storage backend to support pool and volume management
          within the Virtuozzo Storage environment. Virtuozzo Storage is
          a highly available distributed software defined storage with
          built-in replication and disaster recovery.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Add support for memory backing with file source
        <br />
          Add support in numa topology for file source inside memory backing
          (hugepages are not needed) Three new elements
          &lt;source/&gt;,&lt;access/&gt; and &lt;allocation/&gt; were added
          to &lt;memoryBacking/&gt; element. Also new configuration parameter
          <code>memory_backing_dir</code> was added to qemu.conf.
        </li><li>
          network: make openvswitch call timeout configurable
        <br />
          Adding the ability to specify the timeout value in seconds for
          openvswitch calls in the libvirtd configuration file.
        </li><li>
          bhyve: add e1000 NIC support
        <br />
          Add support for e1000 NIC. Previously, the only available option
          was <code>virtio-net</code>.
        </li><li>
          libxl: add tunneled migration support
        <br />
          Add tunneled migration to libxl driver, which is always capable of
          strong encryption and doesn't require any extra network connection
          other than what's required for remote access of libvirtd.
        </li><li>
          qemu: add rendernode argument
        <br />
          Add a new attribute 'rendernode' to &lt;gl&gt; spice element.
        </li><li>
          nodedev: add drm capability
        <br />
          Add a new 'drm' capability for Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)
          devices, providing device type information.
        </li><li>
          Add API for individual/specific vCPU hotplug
        <br />
          The new API allows selecting specific vCPUs to be added/removed from
          the VM. The existing APIs allowed only adding/removing from the end
          which did not play well with NUMA.
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Improvements</strong>
            <ul><li>
           virsh: pool-list: allow both --uuid and --name in one command
        <br />
          Adjust the virsh-pool command to support the --uuid and/or --name
          options in order to print just the --name and/or --uuid of pools.
        </li><li>
          Introduce MTU to domain &lt;interface/&gt; and &lt;network&gt;
        <br />
          Allow setting MTU size for some types of domain interface
          and network.
        </li><li>
          libxl: improve support for &lt;timer&gt; configurations
        <br />
          Add support for multiple timers. Extend the tsc timer to
          support the emulate mode. Improve conversion of timer XML
          to/from xl.cfg.
        </li><li>
          storage: modularize the storage driver
        <br />
          Split up the storage driver backends into loadable modules so that
          binary distributions don't have to compromise on shipping the storage
          driver with all backends which may pull in too many dependencies.
        </li></ul>
          </li><li>
            <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
            <ul><li>
          nodedev: Fabric name must not be required for fc_host capability
        <br />
          fabric_name is one of many fc_host attributes in Linux that is
          optional and left to the low-level driver to decide if it is
          implemented. For example the zfcp device driver does not provide a
          fabric name for an fcp host. The requirement for the existence of
          a fabric name has been removed by making it optional.
        </li><li>
          bhyve: change address allocation schema for SATA disks
        <br />
          Previously, the bhyve driver assigned PCI addresses to SATA disks
          directly rather than assigning that to a controller and
          using SATA addresses for disks. It was implemented this way
          because bhyve has no notion of an explicit SATA controller.
          However, as this doesn't match libvirt's understanding of
          disk addresses, the bhyve driver was changed to follow
          the common schema and have PCI addresses for SATA controllers
          and SATA addresses for disks. If you're having issues
          because of this, it's recommended to edit the domain's XML
          and remove &lt;address type='pci'&gt; from the &lt;disk&gt;
          elements with &lt;target bus='sata'/&gt; and let libvirt
          regenerate it properly.

          Fix reporting of domain maximum memory. Fix setting dom0

          qemu: Allow empty script path to &lt;interface/&gt;
        <br />
          Historically, this was always allowed. Unfortunately, due to some
          rework done for 1.3.2 release a bug was dragged in which suddenly
          stop allowing domain with such configuration to start.

          New <code>libvirt_guest</code> nss module that translates libvirt
          guest names into IP addresses.
        </li><li>
          daemon: Add support for runtime logging settings adjustment
        <br />
          Logging-related settings like log outputs and filters can now be
          adjusted during runtime using the admin interface without the
          necessity of the daemon's restart.
        </li><li>
          storage: Add virStorageVolInfoFlags API
        <br />
          Add the API to support using the VIR_STORAGE_VOL_GET_PHYSICAL
          flag in order to return the host physical size in bytes
          of the image container in the allocation field of the
          _virStorageVolInfo structure. The --physical flag has been
          added to the virsh vol-info command to access the data.
        </li><li>
          libxl: Implement virDomainGetMaxVcpus API
        </li><li>
          storage: Add overwrite flag checking for logical pool

          perf: Add more perf statistics
        <br />
          Add support to get the count of branch instructions
          executed, branch misses, bus cycles, stalled frontend
          cpu cycles, stalled backend cpu cycles, and ref cpu
          cycles by applications running on the platform.

          volume in the output of the volume XML.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Use virtio-pci by default for aarch64 mach-virt guests
        <br />
          virtio-pci provides several advantages over virtio-mmio, such
          as the ability to hotplug devices and improved performance.
          While opting in to virtio-pci has been possible for a while,
          newly-defined guests will now use it automatically.
        </li><li>
          vbox: remove support for VirtualBox 3.x and older
        <br />
          Those old VirtualBox versions have been unsupported by
          upstream for a long time and the API of 4.0 and newer has
          diverged enough to require code abstractions to handle differences.
          Removing support for those old versions drops lots of code from
          the driver and simplifies the logic to ease implementation of new
          features going forward.
        </li><li>
          virsh: pool-info: introduce option --bytes
        <br />
          Add option --bytes to virsh pool-info in order ti allow display

          scsi: Add parent wwnn/wwpn or fabric capability for createVport
        <br />
          Improve the algorithm searching for the parent scsi_host device
          for vHBA/NPIV scsi_host creation. Rather than supplying the
          "parent" by name, it's now possible to define the parent by
          it's wwnn/wwpn or fabric_wwn in the node device create XML or
          the storage pool XML.
        </li><li>
          qemu: aggregate pcie-root-ports onto multiple functions of a slot
        <br />
          When pcie-root-ports are added to pcie-root in order to
          provide a place to connect PCI Express endpoint devices,
          libvirt now aggregates multiple root ports together onto the
          same slot (up to 8 per slot) in order to conserve slots.
          Using this method, it's possible to connect more than 200
          endpoint devices to a guest that uses PCIe without requiring
          setup of any PCIe switches.

            <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
            <ul><li>
          lxc: fix accidental killing of containers during libvirtd restart
        <br />
          The libvirt_lxc process was previously not moved into the
          container scope. As a result, if systemd reloads its config
          after a container is started, when libvirtd is later restarted
          it will accidentally kill the containers.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Correct GetBlockInfo values
        <br />
          For an active domain, correct the physical value provided for
          a raw sparse file backed storage and the allocation value provided
          for a qcow2 file backed storage that hasn't yet been opened on
          the domain.

          qemu: Enable mount namespace
        <br />
          To avoid funny races with udev relabelling devices under our hands and
          to enhance security, libvirt now spawns each qemu process with its own
          <code>/dev</code>.
        </li><li>
          storage: Fix implementation of no-overwrite for file system backend
        <br />
          Fix file system storage backend implementation of the OVERWRITE
          flags to be consistent between code and documentation. Add checks
          to ensure that when building a new file system on a target volume
          that there is not something already on the disk in a format that
          libvirt can recognize.
        </li><li>
          qemu: Create hugepage path on per domain basis
        <br />
          Historically, all hugepage enabled domains shared the same path under
          hugetlbfs. This left libvirt unable to correctly set security labels
          on it. With this release, however, each domain is put into a
          separate path which is also correctly labeled.
        </li><li>
          conf: Reject domains with duplicate drive addresses
        <br />
          Reject duplicate drive addresses for disks and hostdevs at
          domain definition.
        </li><li>
          libxl: reverse defaults on HVM net device attach
        <br />
          Fixes network interface attach for HVM domains when no model is
          specified. Emulated hotplug isn't yet supported and hence we should
          default to the general working scenario.

          libxl: always enable pae for x86_64 HVM
        <br />
          By default pae is disabled in libxl. Without an explicit &lt;pae/&gt;
          setting in the domain &lt;features&gt; configuration, an x86_64 HVM
          domain would be get an i686 environment. pae should always be enabled
          for x86_64 HVM domains.

        <h3>
          <strong>v2.5.0 (2016-12-04)</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul><li>
            <strong>New features</strong>
            <ul><li>
          shmem: Add support for additional models
        <br />
          The shmem device can now utilize QEMU's ivshmem-plain and
          ivshmem-doorbell, more modern versions of ivshmem.
        </li><li>
          vbox: Add VirtualBox 5.1 support
        </li><li>
          libssh: New transport
        <br />
          The new libssh transport allows one to connect to a running
          libvirtd via SSH, using the libssh library; for example:
          <code>qemu+libssh://server/system</code>.
        </li><li>
          vhost-scsi: Add support scsi_host hostdev passthrough
        <br />
          Add the capability to pass through a scsi_host HBA and the
          associated LUNs to the guest.
        </li><li>
          Allow debugging of gluster volumes in qemu
        <br />
          Users can now enable debug logging for native gluster
          volumes in qemu using the "gluster_debug_level" option in qemu.conf
        </li><li>
          Pre-allocate memory slots for memory hotplug
        <br />
          Slot numbers for memory devices are now automatically allocated and
          thus persistent. In addition slot numbers can be specified without
          providing a base address, which simplifies user configuration
        </li><li>
          qemu: Express devices will be placed on PCIe bus by default
        <br />
          For machine types that use a PCI Express root bus
          (e.g. x86_64/Q35 and aarch64/virt), any unaddressed PCI
          device that is an Express device (all virtio-1.0 devices,
          e1000e, nec-xhci, vfio assigned devices) will be placed on
          an Express controller (i.e. a pcie-root-port) instead of a
          legacy PCI controller (i.e. pci-bridge) with the root ports
          added as needed.

          website: Modernize layout and branding
        <br />
          The libvirt website looked very cluttered and outdated; it has now
          been completely overhauled, resulting in a design that's better
          organized and more pleasant to look at.
