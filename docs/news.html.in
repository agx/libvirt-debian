    <h3>v2.5.0 (<i>unreleased</i>)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New features</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>shmem: Add support for additional models<br/>
          The shmem device can now utilize QEMU's ivshmem-plain and
          ivshmem-doorbell, more modern versions of ivshmem
          </li>
          <li>vbox: Add VirtualBox 5.1 support
          </li>
          <li>libssh: New transport<br/>
          The new libssh transport allows one to connect to a running
          libvirtd via SSH, using the libssh library; for example:
          <tt>qemu+libssh://<i>server</i>/system</tt>
          </li>
          <li>vhost-scsi: Add support scsi_host hostdev passthrough<br/>
          Add the capability to pass through a scsi_host HBA and the
          associated LUNs to the guest
          </li>
          <li>qemu: Users can now enable debug logging for native gluster
          volumes in qemu using the "gluster_debug_level" option in qemu.conf
          </li>
          <li>memory hotplug: Slot numbers for memory devices are now
          automatically allocated and thus persistent. In addition slot numbers
          can be specified without providing a base address, which simplifies
          user configuration
          </li>
          <li>qemu: Express devices will be placed on PCIe bus by default<br/>
          For machine types that use a PCI Express root bus
          (e.g. x86_64/Q35 and aarch64/virt), any unaddressed PCI
          device that is an Express device (all virtio-1.0 devices,
          e1000e, nec-xhci, vfio assigned devices) will be placed on
          an Express controller (i.e. a pcie-root-port) instead of a
          legacy PCI controller (i.e. pci-bridge) with the root ports
          added as needed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Improvements</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>docs: Better documentation for migration APIs and flags
          </li>
          <li>vbox: Address thread safety issues
          </li>
          <li>virsh: Add support for passing an alternative persistent XML
          to migrate command
          </li>
          <li>vhostuser: Allow hotplug of multiqueue devices
          </li>
          <li>NEWS: Switch to an improved format<br/>
          List user-visible changes instead of single commits for a better
          high-level overview of differences between libvirt releases
          </li>
          <li>website: Modernize layout and branding<br/>
          The libvirt website looked very cluttered and outdated; it has now
          been completely overhauled, resulting in a design that's better
          organized and more pleasant to look at
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bug fixes</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>vz: Fix migration in P2P mode
          </li>
          <li>Forbid newline character in names of some libvirt objects
          </li>
          <li>Fix compilation on macOS
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Releases earlier than v2.5.0 detailed their changes using a different
    format and as such are excluded from the list above.
