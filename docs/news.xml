          Domain events for metadata content changes
        </summary>
        <description>
          The domain events framework has a new event ID that can
          be used to get notifications when domain metadata content
          changes.

        <description>
          Logging-related settings like log outputs and filters can now be
          adjusted during runtime using the admin interface without the

          storage: Add virStorageVolInfoFlags API

        <description>
          Add the API to support using the VIR_STORAGE_VOL_GET_PHYSICAL
          flag in order to return the host physical size in bytes
          of the image container in the allocation field of the
          _virStorageVolInfo structure. The --physical flag has been
          added to the virsh vol-info command to access the data.

          qemu: Use virtio-pci by default for aarch64 mach-virt guests
        </summary>
        <description>
          virtio-pci provides several advantages over virtio-mmio, such
          as the ability to hotplug devices and improved performance.
          While opting in to virtio-pci has been possible for a while,
          newly-defined guests will now use it automatically.

          vbox: remove support for VirtualBox 3.x and older
        </summary>
        <description>
          Those old VirtualBox versions have been unsupported by
          upstream for a long time and the API of 4.0 and newer has
          diverged enough to require code abstractions to handle differences.
          Removing support for those old versions drops lots of code from
          the driver and simplifies the logic to ease implementation of new
          features going forward.

          scsi: Add parent wwnn/wwpn or fabric capability for createVport

        <description>
          Improve the algorithm searching for the parent scsi_host device
          for vHBA/NPIV scsi_host creation. Rather than supplying the
          "parent" by name, it's now possible to define the parent by
          it's wwnn/wwpn or fabric_wwn in the node device create XML or
          the storage pool XML.

          qemu: aggregate pcie-root-ports onto multiple functions of a slot
        </summary>
        <description>
          When pcie-root-ports are added to pcie-root in order to
          provide a place to connect PCI Express endpoint devices,
          libvirt now aggregates multiple root ports together onto the
          same slot (up to 8 per slot) in order to conserve slots.
          Using this method, it's possible to connect more than 200
          endpoint devices to a guest that uses PCIe without requiring
          setup of any PCIe switches.

        <summary>
          lxc: fix accidental killing of containers during libvirtd restart
        </summary>
        <description>
          The libvirt_lxc process was previously not moved into the
          container scope. As a result, if systemd reloads its config
          after a container is started, when libvirtd is later restarted
          it will accidentally kill the containers.

          For an active domain, correct the physical value provided for
          a raw sparse file backed storage and the allocation value provided
          for a qcow2 file backed storage that hasn't yet been opened on
          the domain.

        <description>
          To avoid funny races with udev relabelling devices under our hands and
          to enhance security, libvirt now spawns each qemu process with its own
          <code>/dev</code>.

        <description>
          Fix file system storage backend implementation of the OVERWRITE
          flags to be consistent between code and documentation. Add checks
          to ensure that when building a new file system on a target volume
          that there is not something already on the disk in a format that
          libvirt can recognize.

          qemu: Create hugepage path on per domain basis
        </summary>
        <description>
          Historically, all hugepage enabled domains shared the same path under
          hugetlbfs. This left libvirt unable to correctly set security labels
          on it. With this release, however, each domain is put into a
          separate path which is also correctly labeled.

          libxl: reverse defaults on HVM net device attach
        </summary>
        <description>
          Fixes network interface attach for HVM domains when no model is
          specified. Emulated hotplug isn't yet supported and hence we should
          default to the general working scenario.

          libxl: always enable pae for x86_64 HVM
        </summary>
        <description>
          By default pae is disabled in libxl. Without an explicit &lt;pae/&gt;
          setting in the domain &lt;features&gt; configuration, an x86_64 HVM
          domain would be get an i686 environment. pae should always be enabled
          for x86_64 HVM domains.

        <description>
          For machine types that use a PCI Express root bus
          (e.g. x86_64/Q35 and aarch64/virt), any unaddressed PCI
          device that is an Express device (all virtio-1.0 devices,
          e1000e, nec-xhci, vfio assigned devices) will be placed on
          an Express controller (i.e. a pcie-root-port) instead of a
          legacy PCI controller (i.e. pci-bridge) with the root ports
          added as needed.
