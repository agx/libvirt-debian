# This is a whitelist that allows accesses to files not in our
# build directory nor source directory. The records are in the
# following format:
#
#  $path: $progname: $testname
#
# All these three are evaluated as perl RE. So to allow /dev/sda
# and /dev/sdb, you can just '/dev/sd[a-b]', or to allow
# /proc/$pid/status you can '/proc/\d+/status' and so on.
# Moreover, $progname and $testname can be empty, in which which
# case $path is allowed for all tests.
